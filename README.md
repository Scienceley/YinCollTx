# YinCollTx
First code where I saw a Peak Valley distribution. Name is YinColl, because I took the collimator parameters from Yuting Lin 2025 and misread the name, and Tx because the overall geometry is based of of ThomX.

MATLAB code was used to analyse the output files, I am happy to share if interested.
